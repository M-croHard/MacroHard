Nick - Jed Owns a small bar that has a dance floor and stage that holds about 300 people. He has been having concerts at his location for about a decade and wants more options to sell tickets other than cash at the door. He’s well versed in technology and wants a solution that is easy for him and his employees to use and that doesn’t take too much from his bottom line.

Brady - Jodi is an older lady (kind of a helicopter parent) that struggles with tech. Her son has shown her the cool new ticket app that he uses. Jodi would like to see her son play at these events, but only wants to see the location, date/time her son plays and no other events. She wants a app that helps her keep track of her son’s play times that is simple for her to use.

Tyler - Carl is a college music student who loves going to concerts, he frequents them weekly. While he doesn't mind using other ticket systems like ticket master, he's mad that they charge an arm and leg on random fees. He also likes more local concerts that currently the only way to get tickets is at the door with cash he'd love another way to get those tickets. Being a college student Carl lives off his phone using apps and the browser constantly.

Eli - George loves attending concerts and wants to attend more concerts this summer but hates having tickets that he can physically lose. George also hates searching several websites for prices he can afford. He would love something on his phone that he can search for tickets at prices he can afford and keep them stored digitally on his phone so he can't lose them.

Eli - George (Concert Goer):
George is waiting in the large line for the concert and finally gets to the front, he pulls out his phone to have the employee scan his ticket but there is an error. It was the wrong ticket! He swipes through the tickets through the app and finds the write one. He was glad he didn't drive 3 hours to the concert grounds just to have grabbed the wrong ticket to take with him.

Eli - Billy (Concert Goer):
Billy is looking for concerts in the area to woo this girl he has been talking too. He goes the app and looks for available concerts in his area and finds one that he thinks that both he and his date will enjoy. He purchases two tickets quickly and easily and is happy with the experience. The day of the concert comes but oh no! His date cancelled on him, but not to worry Billy can still refund his tickets with a simple refund option.

Tyler - Carl
Carl heard about a sweet local concert and wants some tickets before the concert starts. He goes online to our app Ticket Blaster and searches for the concert he wants, he enters in how many tickets he wants and is prompted to pay, after paying he then gets his ticket on his phone which he is also able to print if he'd like. 

Tyler - Carl
Carl doesn't always keep up with the current events of concerts but through the app he can select his preferred genres. Then a band has a concert and sets up tickets to be sold on the app, and the genre matches Carl recieves an alert or email saying that a new show is coming to town and will link him to the appropiate page to purchase the tickets if he chooses to do so.  

Brady - Mandy 
Mandy heard from a freind who uses the app how great it is. She was able to download it from her phone and desktop using the same account! She wanted to make sure that the bands didn't mix with her work schedual, so she set the app to only show specific dates. She then booked all of her favroite local/ regional events for her days!

Brady - Jenna Dikin 
Jenna Dikin is new to the entertainment industry and wants to help grow her bussiness by grabbing the attention of artist to play at her Bar. By using the app she sets up the days the bar is availible for booking and adds pictures of the stage to help attract enthusiastic artist wanting to play. She is quickly notified of all the request and is given a list of whom to allow to play at her bar.

Nick – Jed has an upcoming event with a local band. The time, location and ticket prices are set. The day of the concert, one of the band members brings up the idea of a food drive that is happening in town and was wondering if it was possible for people who buy tickets at the door through the app to get a discount if they bring a nonperishable food item. At first Jed says no because he thinks it would be too hard of a change with such short notice. After looking over the app and the ticket prices he sees that there is a way to add another ticket option for the event. He creates the food drive option with a $2 discount for in person sales only and contacts the band member with the good news. The band member gets on social media and informs everyone about the discount and they are able to partake in the local food drive that evening.
